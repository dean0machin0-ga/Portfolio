# Dean Walton's Digital Showcase

## Introduction

Hello! I'm Dean Walton, a software engineering student at General Assembly, set to graduate on 1/24/24. I'm thrilled to embark on my journey in the tech field as a full-stack junior developer. 

With a decade's worth of experience in aerospace machining and programming, I've had the privilege of designing and fabricating parts for the Department of Defense and Boeing. My passion for technology and problem-solving led me to transition into software engineering, where I'm eager to apply my skills to create innovative solutions.

When I'm not coding, you can find me spending quality time with my two wonderful children or shredding the slopes while snowboarding in the beautiful Pacific Northwest.
